# Embodies a Coaching Mindset

## Official ICF Definition

**Embodies a Coaching Mindset:** Develops and maintains a mindset that is open, curious, flexible and client-centered.

## Overview

"Embodies a Coaching Mindset" is one of the two foundational competencies in the ICF Core Competencies framework, alongside "Demonstrates Ethical Practice." This competency focuses on the coach's overall approach, attitude, and ongoing professional development rather than specific behaviors within a single coaching session.

What makes this competency unique is that it represents an ongoing process of development that takes place over the course of a coach's professional journey. While certain elements of this competency can be demonstrated within a coaching conversation, the full embodiment of a coaching mindset cannot be fully captured in a single moment in time.

## Key Aspects of Embodying a Coaching Mindset

According to the ICF, embodying a coaching mindset involves:

1. **Acknowledging that clients are responsible** for their own choices
2. **Engaging in ongoing learning and development** as a coach
3. **Developing and maintaining a reflective practice** to enhance self-awareness
4. **Remaining aware of and open to the influence of context and culture** on oneself and others
5. **Using awareness of self and intuition** to benefit clients

8. **Seeking help from outside sources** when necessary

2. **Continuing education** - Ongoing learning through workshops, readings, and courses

4. **Peer consultation** - Discussing challenges and insights with other coaches

## Evolution in the Revised ICF Competency Model

The "Embodies a Coaching Mindset" competency was newly added in the revised ICF Core Competency model. This addition highlights several important aspects of professional coaching:

1. **The importance of ongoing professional development** - Recognizing that coaching mastery is a continuous journey
2. **The value of reflective practice** - Emphasizing the coach's self-awareness and learning
3. **The coach's presence as a foundational element** - Acknowledging that who the coach is being impacts the coaching relationship
4. **The spiritual dimension of coaching** - Recognizing that mastery requires nurturing our inner capacity to connect, notice, attune and express

As noted by coaching experts, a coach who isn't engaged in their own ongoing practice of inner work has limited capacity to recognize the growth available for their client. The ability to embrace our full selves enables us to more fully embrace our clients.

## The Role of Ongoing Learning in This Competency

A significant component of embodying a coaching mindset is the commitment to ongoing learning and development. This involves:

1. **Staying current with coaching research and best practices**
2. **Expanding knowledge in adjacent fields** that inform coaching
3. **Seeking feedback on coaching performance**
4. **Experimenting with new approaches and methods**
5. **Engaging with the broader coaching community**

An important aspect of this is that Professional Certified Coaches (PCCs) and Master Certified Coaches (MCCs) should engage in examination and growth of their coaching skills beyond acquiring continuing coach education units (CCEUs). This includes analyzing recorded coaching sessions against the core competencies with mentor coaches to continue refining their practice.

## Conclusion

"Embodies a Coaching Mindset" represents the being aspect of coaching, as opposed to the doing. While specific behaviors can demonstrate this mindset in action, the competency is fundamentally about the coach's ongoing development journey and the consciousness they bring to each coaching relationship. By cultivating openness, curiosity, flexibility, and client-centeredness, coaches create the foundation for transformative coaching conversations.

The addition of this competency to the ICF framework acknowledges that coaching excellence is not merely about mastering techniques, but about developing oneself as an instrument of service to clients. It recognizes that how a coach shows up—mentally, emotionally, and spiritually—is as important as what the coach does in the coaching conversation.
