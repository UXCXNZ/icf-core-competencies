# Establishes and Maintains Agreements

## Official ICF Definition

**Establishes and Maintains Agreements:** Partners with the client and relevant stakeholders to create clear agreements about the coaching relationship, process, plans and goals. Establishes agreements for the overall coaching engagement as well as those for each coaching session.

## Overview

"Establishes and Maintains Agreements" is the first competency in the "Co-Creating the Relationship" domain of the ICF Core Competencies framework. This competency focuses on how coaches create clarity and alignment with clients about expectations, goals, and processes. Effective agreements provide the foundation for successful coaching relationships and outcomes.

This competency recognizes the importance of both the overall coaching engagement agreements (between various stakeholders) and the specific client-driven agenda for each coaching session.

## PCC Markers for This Competency

The following markers are used to assess this competency in coaching conversations:

### 3.1: Coach partners with the client to identify or reconfirm what the client wants to accomplish in this session.
- The coach works collaboratively with the client to determine the focus of the coaching session
- The coach invites the client to articulate their desired outcomes for the conversation
- The coach checks for alignment on session goals throughout the conversation

### 3.2: Coach partners with the client to define or reconfirm measure(s) of success for what the client wants to accomplish in this session.
- The coach helps the client identify how they will know the session has been valuable
- The coach invites the client to articulate what success looks like for the topic being discussed
- The coach ensures there's clarity about what constitutes progress or achievement

### 3.3: Coach inquires about or explores what is important or meaningful to the client about what they want to accomplish in this session.
- The coach invites the client to connect session goals with deeper values or motivations
- The coach explores why this topic matters to the client at this particular time
- The coach helps surface underlying significance of the client's desired outcomes

### 3.4: Coach partners with the client to define what the client believes they need to address to achieve what they want to accomplish in this session.
- The coach collaborates with the client to identify key aspects to explore
- The coach helps the client determine what elements need attention to reach their goals
- The coach allows the client to direct the path of exploration needed to achieve their outcomes

## Examples in Coaching Conversations

### Establishing Session Agreements
- "What would you like to focus on in our conversation today?"
- "What's the most important thing for us to address in our time together?"
- "Among everything you've mentioned, what would be most valuable to explore further?"
- "How will you know this session has been helpful to you?"
- "What would make this time well spent from your perspective?"

### Exploring Meaning and Importance
- "What makes this topic particularly important to you right now?"
- "How does this connect to your bigger goals or values?"
- "When you imagine having made progress on this, what difference would that make?"
- "What's at stake for you in this situation?"

### Defining Areas to Address
- "What do you think we need to explore to help you move forward with this?"
- "What aspects of this situation do you believe are most critical to address?"
- "What would be most useful for us to focus on first?"
- "What do you see as the key elements we should work through?"

## Differences Between MCC and PCC Level

The establishment and maintenance of agreements shows up differently at different credential levels:

### At PCC Level
- Clear partnering with the client to identify session goals
- Explicit discussion of what success looks like for the session
- Exploration of why the topic matters to the client
- Collaborative determination of what needs to be addressed
- Checking in periodically on the agreement

### At MCC Level
- More fluid and organic agreement process that evolves naturally
- Deeper exploration of the significance and context of client goals
- Greater attunement to subtle shifts in what the client wants to accomplish
- More emphasis on the "who" of the client in relation to their goals
- Masterful dancing between immediate goals and broader client aspirations

## Types of Agreements in Coaching

This competency encompasses different types of agreements:

### 1. Overall Coaching Engagement Agreements

- **Boundaries** - What is and isn't part of the coaching relationship
- **Stakeholder Involvement** - How sponsors or other stakeholders will be involved
- **Evaluation** - How progress and outcomes will be assessed

### 2. Session-Specific Agreements
- **Session Focus** - The specific topic or goal for an individual session
- **Success Measures** - How client will know the session was valuable
- **Process Agreements** - How coach and client will work together in the session
- **Time Management** - How to use the available time most effectively

At its best, this competency enables coaches and clients to collaborate with clarity of purpose and shared understanding of what success looks like.
