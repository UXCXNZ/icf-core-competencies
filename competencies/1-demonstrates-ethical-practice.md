"Demonstrates Ethical Practice" is one of the two foundational competencies in the ICF Core Competencies framework. This competency focuses on the coach's understanding and application of ethical standards that guide professional coaching practice. A coach's ethical practice creates the bedrock of trust necessary for effective coaching relationships.

## Key Elements of Demonstrating Ethical Practice

8. **Distinguishing between coaching and other interactions** such as consulting, therapy, or mentoring
9. **Providing accurate information about coaching qualifications and credentials**

## Assessment of This Competency
