# Listens Actively

## Official ICF Definition

**Listens Actively:** Focuses on what the client is and is not saying to fully understand what is being communicated in the context of the client systems and to support client self-expression.

## Overview

"Listens Actively" is the first competency in the "Communicating Effectively" domain of the ICF Core Competencies framework. This competency focuses on the coach's ability to attend to the client at multiple levels, going beyond merely hearing words to understanding meaning, context, emotions, values, and what remains unspoken. Active listening is one of the most fundamental coaching skills, creating the foundation for all other coaching processes.

In the revised ICF competency model, there is a significant emphasis on considering "the client's context, identity, environment, experiences, values and beliefs to enhance understanding of what the client is communicating." This represents a more holistic and systems-aware approach to listening that acknowledges the client as operating within broader contexts and influences.

## Examples in Coaching Conversations

- "You've described yourself as someone who typically needs time to process. How is that showing up in this situation?"
- "Based on what you've shared about your team culture, what challenges do you anticipate in implementing this approach?"

### Exploring Client's Language
- "You used the word 'overwhelmed' several times. Can you tell me more about what that experience is like for you?"
- "You mentioned feeling 'stuck.' What does being 'stuck' look like in this context?"
- "I noticed you described this as a 'disaster.' What makes it feel like a disaster to you?"

### Inquiring About Emotions

- "From what you've shared, you value both honesty and kindness, and you're trying to find a way to honor both in this conversation."

## The Role of Silence in Active Listening

Silence is a powerful component of active listening that:

1. **Creates space for thinking** - Allows clients time to process and reflect
2. **Demonstrates respect** - Shows value for the client's thought process
3. **Reduces pressure** - Removes the urgency to respond immediately
4. **Invites depth** - Encourages movement beyond surface-level responses
5. **Builds comfort with discomfort** - Helps clients develop capacity to stay with challenging thoughts
6. **Allows integration** - Gives time for insights to settle and connect

## Barriers to Active Listening

Common challenges in this competency include:

1. **Internal distractions** - Coach's own thoughts, judgments, or planning
2. **Solution orientation** - Rushing to fix rather than fully understanding
3. **Interpretation bias** - Filtering what is heard through coach's own perspective
4. **Selective listening** - Attending only to parts that align with coach's focus
5. **Rehearsing responses** - Preparing what to say instead of fully listening
6. **Assumption making** - Filling in gaps without checking understanding
7. **Cultural differences** - Misinterpreting communication patterns across cultures

## Strategies for Developing Active Listening

Coaches can develop "Listens Actively" through:

1. **Mindfulness practices** - Cultivating present-moment awareness
2. **Reflection exercises** - Reviewing recordings to notice listening patterns
3. **Paraphrasing practice** - Working on concise, accurate reflection of content
4. **Emotion vocabulary expansion** - Developing nuanced language for feelings
5. **Curiosity cultivation** - Strengthening genuine interest in others' experiences
6. **Somatic awareness** - Increasing attention to bodily responses
7. **Cultural competence development** - Learning varied communication styles
8. **Silence comfort building** - Practicing with longer pauses and spaces

## Systems Awareness in Listening

The revised competency emphasizes understanding "the client systems," recognizing that clients exist within multiple contexts that influence their perspectives and experiences. This systems awareness includes consideration of:

1. **Organizational systems** - Workplace culture, structures, and dynamics
2. **Family systems** - Patterns, roles, and relationships
3. **Cultural systems** - Values, norms, and worldviews
4. **Social systems** - Community connections and social location
5. **Historical context** - Past experiences that shape current understanding
6. **Power dynamics** - Influences of authority, privilege, and position

By listening with systems awareness, coaches can help clients recognize how these contexts shape their thinking and open possibilities for transformation.

## Supporting Client Self-Expression

A key outcome of active listening is supporting the client's ability to fully express themselves. This happens when coaches:

1. **Create psychological safety** - Establish a non-judgmental environment
2. **Demonstrate unconditional positive regard** - Show genuine acceptance
3. **Follow the client's lead** - Allow exploration of what matters to them
4. **Notice and name patterns** - Help clients become aware of their communication
5. **Ask clarifying questions** - Invite deeper articulation
6. **Respect the client's pace** - Honor their process of unfolding understanding
7. **Reflect without distortion** - Mirror back accurately what has been expressed

## Relationship to Other Competencies

"Listens Actively" connects closely with other competencies:

1. **Maintains Presence** - Presence creates the foundation for deep listening
2. **Cultivates Trust and Safety** - Active listening builds trust and safety
3. **Evokes Awareness** - Listening reveals opportunities for powerful questions
4. **Embodies a Coaching Mindset** - Curiosity and openness enable effective listening
5. **Facilitates Client Growth** - Listening helps identify the client's learning edge

## Conclusion

"Listens Actively" is often considered the heart of coaching. Through deep, multi-dimensional listening, coaches create the conditions for clients to feel truly heard, sometimes for the first time. This experience of being heard catalyzes self-discovery, clarity, and new awareness.

Beyond technique, active listening represents a profound way of being with another person—offering the gift of full attention and genuine curiosity. When coaches listen at this level, they create a space where clients can hear themselves more clearly, discover new insights, and access their own wisdom.

As the foundation for all other coaching competencies, the quality of a coach's listening largely determines the depth and impact of the coaching relationship. By developing exceptional listening skills, coaches create the conditions for transformative conversations that expand possibilities and foster meaningful change.
