# Maintains Presence

## Official ICF Definition

**Maintains Presence:** Is fully conscious and present with the client, employing a style that is open, flexible, grounded and confident.

## Overview

"Maintains Presence" is the third competency in the "Co-Creating the Relationship" domain of the ICF Core Competencies framework. This competency focuses on the quality of attention and being that the coach brings to the coaching relationship. It represents the coach's ability to be fully engaged with the client moment-to-moment, creating a container of awareness within which coaching can unfold.

Presence is often described as the "being" dimension of coaching, in contrast to the "doing" elements. It involves bringing one's full self to the coaching relationship with authenticity, openness, and attunement to what is emerging both within the client and within the coaching conversation itself.

- "Coming back to what you wanted to explore today, how is this connecting to your objective?"
- "Of the possibilities we've discussed, which ones seem most relevant to what you want to accomplish?"
- "I'm curious how this aspect relates to the outcome you're seeking."

### Supporting Client Choice
- "I have several directions we could explore next. Would you prefer to focus on the practical steps, the underlying mindset, or something else entirely?"
- "Where would you like to take this conversation now?"

### Demonstrating Curiosity

## Distinction Between Coaching Presence and Mindset

While closely related to "Embodies a Coaching Mindset," the "Maintains Presence" competency has a distinct focus:

- **Embodies a Coaching Mindset** - The ongoing development of the coach's overall approach to coaching
- **Maintains Presence** - The moment-to-moment quality of attention and being in coaching sessions

In the revised competency model, "Maintains Presence" focuses specifically on the presence the coach brings to the coaching session environment, while "Embodies a Coaching Mindset" addresses the overall and ongoing development of the coach's approach.

5. **Self-consciousness** - Worrying about one's performance as a coach
6. **Emotional reactivity** - Getting caught in emotional responses to client content
7. **Cognitive overload** - Trying to track too many elements simultaneously

## Strategies for Developing This Competency

Coaches can develop "Maintains Presence" through:

1. **Mindfulness practices** - Meditation, centering exercises, or breath awareness
2. **Somatic awareness** - Body-based practices to develop groundedness
3. **Pre-session rituals** - Creating consistent preparation routines
4. **Supervision and reflection** - Examining moments of presence and non-presence
5. **Presence breaks** - Taking short pauses between sessions to reset

## Conclusion

"Maintains Presence" represents the art of being fully with a client in the coaching relationship.

Through quality of presence, coaches create a container for transformation that goes beyond techniques or methodologies.

While presence can be challenging to describe, it is immediately felt by clients and has a profound impact on the coaching relationship. When coaches maintain presence, they create the conditions for clients to access their own wisdom, explore with courage, and discover new possibilities. Ultimately, the quality of a coach's presence may be the most important gift they offer their clients.
