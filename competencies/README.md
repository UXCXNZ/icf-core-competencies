# ICF Core Competencies

This directory contains detailed documentation for each of the eight International Coach Federation (ICF) Core Competencies as defined in the updated 2020 framework. Each file provides comprehensive information about a single competency, including its definition, PCC markers, examples, development strategies, and relationship to other competencies.

## The ICF Core Competency Framework

The ICF Core Competency framework is organized into four domains containing a total of eight competencies:

### A. Foundation
1. [Demonstrates Ethical Practice](1-demonstrates-ethical-practice.md)
2. [Embodies a Coaching Mindset](2-embodies-coaching-mindset.md)

### B. Co-Creating the Relationship
3. [Establishes and Maintains Agreements](3-establishes-maintains-agreements.md)
4. [Cultivates Trust and Safety](4-cultivates-trust-safety.md)
5. [Maintains Presence](5-maintains-presence.md)

### C. Communicating Effectively
6. [Listens Actively](6-listens-actively.md)
7. [Evokes Awareness](7-evokes-awareness.md)

### D. Cultivating Learning and Growth
8. [Facilitates Client Growth](8-facilitates-client-growth.md)

## Understanding PCC Markers

Each competency (except for Demonstrates Ethical Practice) has specific behavioral markers that assessors use to evaluate coaching performance. These markers represent observable behaviors that demonstrate the competency in action during coaching conversations.

The markers are organized by competency number, with markers for Competency 3 labeled as 3.1, 3.2, etc. For example, Competency 6 (Listens Actively) has markers 6.1 through 6.7.

It's important to note that these markers are not intended to be used as a checklist but rather as indicators of competent coaching. For more information about how markers are numbered in this repository versus sequential numbering, see the [marker numbering systems documentation](../docs/marker-numbering-systems.md).

## Special Competencies

Two competencies have unique assessment approaches:

1. **Demonstrates Ethical Practice** is considered a pass in performance evaluations unless there are specific indicators that ethics might not be understood. It doesn't have numbered markers like the other competencies.

2. **Embodies a Coaching Mindset** is partially assessed through markers from other competencies (specifically 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 6.1, 6.5, 7.1, and 7.5). This reflects how a coaching mindset manifests through behaviors across multiple competencies.

## PCC vs. MCC Level Competencies

Each competency document includes a section comparing how the competency typically shows up at the Professional Certified Coach (PCC) level versus the Master Certified Coach (MCC) level. This comparison helps coaches understand the developmental progression of each competency and what mastery looks like as coaches advance in their practice.

## Using These Resources

These competency documents can be used for:

1. **Deepening understanding** - Gaining comprehensive knowledge of each competency
2. **Skill development** - Identifying specific behaviors to practice and refine
3. **Session preparation** - Reviewing competencies before coaching conversations
4. **Self-assessment** - Evaluating your coaching against the markers
5. **Mentor coaching preparation** - Preparing for feedback conversations
6. **Credential application** - Understanding assessment criteria for ICF credentials

## Additional Resources

In addition to these competency documents, this repository includes:
- Visualizations of how competencies relate to each other
- Tools for assessing coaching against the competencies
- Implementation guides for applying competencies in practice

We recommend starting with reading each competency document thoroughly, then exploring the relationships between competencies through the [competency marker map](../visualization/competency-marker-map.md).
