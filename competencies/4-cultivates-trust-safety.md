# Cultivates Trust and Safety

## Official ICF Definition

**Cultivates Trust and Safety:** Partners with the client to create a safe, supportive environment that allows the client to share freely. Maintains a relationship of mutual respect and trust.

## Overview

"Cultivates Trust and Safety" is the second competency in the "Co-Creating the Relationship" domain of the ICF Core Competencies framework. This competency focuses on creating the psychological safety necessary for clients to be vulnerable, authentic, and open in the coaching relationship.

Trust and safety form the foundation upon which all other coaching work rests. Without a strong sense of safety, clients are less likely to explore challenging topics, share difficult emotions, or risk moving beyond their comfort zones. By cultivating an environment of trust, coaches enable clients to engage more deeply in the coaching process.
