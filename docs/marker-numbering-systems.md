# Understanding Marker Numbering Systems

This document explains the two numbering systems used for ICF PCC Markers - the official ICF hierarchical numbering system and our internal sequential numbering system. Understanding both systems will help you navigate between the official ICF documentation and our repository resources.

## Official ICF Hierarchical Numbering System

The International Coaching Federation (ICF) uses a hierarchical numbering system that reflects the structure of the Core Competencies framework. In this system, markers are numbered according to their associated competency.

For example:
- 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 are the four markers under Competency 3 (Establishes and Maintains Agreements)
- 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 are the four markers under Competency 4 (Cultivates Trust and Safety)
- And so on...

This system makes it clear which competency a marker belongs to by using the competency number as the prefix. This is the system used in all official ICF documentation and assessment processes.

## Internal Sequential Numbering (1-37)

For some internal tracking and visualization purposes, our repository sometimes uses a sequential numbering system that assigns each marker a unique number from 1 to 37, counting through all competencies in order. This provides a simpler way to reference individual markers without the hierarchical structure.

The mapping between these systems is as follows:

| Sequential # | Official ICF # | Competency and Marker Description |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1 | 3.1 | Coach partners with the client to identify or reconfirm what the client wants to accomplish in this session |
| 2 | 3.2 | Coach partners with the client to define or reconfirm measure(s) of success for what the client wants to accomplish in this session |
| 3 | 3.3 | Coach inquires about or explores what is important or meaningful to the client about what they want to accomplish in this session |
| 4 | 3.4 | Coach partners with the client to define what the client believes they need to address to achieve what they want to accomplish in this session |
| 5 | 4.1 | Coach acknowledges and respects the client's unique talents, insights and work in the coaching process |
| 6 | 4.2 | Coach shows support, empathy or concern for the client |
| 7 | 4.3 | Coach acknowledges and supports the client's expression of feelings, perceptions, concerns, beliefs or suggestions |
| 8 | 4.4 | Coach partners with the client by inviting the client to respond in any way to the coach's contributions and accepts the client's response |
| 9 | 5.1 | Coach acts in response to the whole person of the client (the who) |
| 10 | 5.2 | Coach acts in response to what the client wants to accomplish throughout this session (the what) |
| 11 | 5.3 | Coach partners with the client by supporting the client to choose what happens in this session |
| 12 | 5.4 | Coach demonstrates curiosity to learn more about the client |
| 13 | 5.5 | Coach allows for silence, pause or reflection |
| 14 | 6.1 | Coach's questions and observations are customized by using what the coach has learned about who the client is or the client's situation |
| 15 | 6.2 | Coach inquires about or explores the words the client uses |
| 16 | 6.3 | Coach inquires about or explores the client's emotions |
| 17 | 6.4 | Coach explores the client's energy shifts, nonverbal cues or other behaviors |
| 18 | 6.5 | Coach inquires about or explores how the client currently perceives themself or their world |
| 19 | 6.6 | Coach allows the client to complete speaking without interrupting unless there is a stated coaching purpose to do so |
| 20 | 6.7 | Coach succinctly reflects or summarizes what the client communicated to ensure the client's clarity and understanding |
| 21 | 7.1 | Coach asks questions about the client, such as their current way of thinking, feeling, values, needs, wants, beliefs or behavior |
| 22 | 7.2 | Coach asks questions to help the client explore beyond the client's current thinking or feeling to new or expanded ways of thinking or feeling about themself (the who) |
| 23 | 7.3 | Coach asks questions to help the client explore beyond the client's current thinking or feeling to new or expanded ways of thinking or feeling about their situation (the what) |
| 24 | 7.4 | Coach asks questions to help the client explore beyond current thinking, feeling or behaving toward the outcome the client desires |
| 25 | 7.5 | Coach shares—with no attachment—observations, intuitions, comments, thoughts or feelings, and invites the client's exploration through verbal or tonal invitation |
| 26 | 7.6 | Coach asks clear, direct, primarily open-ended questions, one at a time, at a pace that allows for thinking, feeling or reflection by the client |
| 27 | 7.7 | Coach uses language that is generally clear and concise |
| 28 | 7.8 | Coach allows the client to do most of the talking |
| 29 | 8.1 | Coach invites or allows the client to explore progress toward what the client wanted to accomplish in this session |
| 30 | 8.2 | Coach invites the client to state or explore the client's learning in this session about themself (the who) |
| 31 | 8.3 | Coach invites the client to state or explore the client's learning in this session about their situation (the what) |
| 32 | 8.4 | Coach invites the client to consider how they will use new learning from this coaching session |
| 33 | 8.5 | Coach partners with the client to design post-session thinking, reflection or action |
| 34 | 8.6 | Coach partners with the client to consider how to move forward, including resources, support or potential barriers |
| 35 | 8.7 | Coach partners with the client to design the best methods of accountability for themself |
| 36 | 8.8 | Coach celebrates the client's progress and learning |
| 37 | 8.9 | Coach partners with the client on how they want to complete this session |

## Why Two Numbering Systems?

While the official ICF hierarchical system is the authoritative standard and should be used when referencing the markers in formal contexts (such as assessments, training materials, and credential applications), the sequential numbering system can be useful in certain situations:

1. **Visualization purposes**: When creating diagrams or visual representations where a simpler numbering system makes the visuals cleaner and easier to read
2. **Data analysis**: When analyzing patterns across all markers, a sequential system can be easier to work with
3. **Quick reference**: For internal discussions or shorthand notation where the full hierarchical numbering is cumbersome

## Recommended Best Practices

To avoid confusion between these two numbering systems:

1. **Always clarify which system you're using** when discussing markers with colleagues
2. **Use the official ICF hierarchical system** in any formal documentation or when communicating with ICF
3. **Include both numbers when possible** to help build familiarity with both systems
4. **For new resources, prioritize the official ICF system** to align with industry standards

## Embodies a Coaching Mindset Markers

It's important to note that Competency 2 (Embodies a Coaching Mindset) doesn't have its own uniquely numbered markers. Instead, it's assessed through markers from other competencies: 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 6.1, 6.5, 7.1, and 7.5.

In our sequential numbering system, these correspond to markers: 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 18, 21, and 25.

## Demonstrates Ethical Practice

Similarly, Competency 1 (Demonstrates Ethical Practice) doesn't have specifically numbered markers. This is assessed through overall alignment with the ICF Code of Ethics in the coaching conversation.

## Conclusion

Understanding both numbering systems allows you to effectively navigate between official ICF materials and our repository resources. When in doubt, always default to the official ICF hierarchical numbering system (3.1, 4.2, etc.) as it is the recognized standard in the coaching profession.
