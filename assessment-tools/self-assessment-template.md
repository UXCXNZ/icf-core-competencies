- **2 = Applying**: I demonstrate this competency regularly but not yet with consistent mastery
- **3 = Integrating**: I demonstrate this competency consistently and effectively in most coaching situations
- **4 = Mastering**: I demonstrate this competency with sophistication and artistry in virtually all coaching situations
