# ICF Core Competencies Reference Guide

This repository serves as a comprehensive reference for professional coaches following the International Coach Federation (ICF) Core Competencies framework. The materials are organized to help coaches understand, implement, and demonstrate these competencies in their coaching practice.

## About the ICF Core Competencies

The ICF Core Competencies form the foundation of professional coaching practice as defined by the International Coach Federation. These competencies are organized into four main domains with a total of 8 core competencies:

### A. Foundation
1. **Demonstrates Ethical Practice**
2. **Embodies a Coaching Mindset**

### B. Co-Creating the Relationship
3. **Establishes and Maintains Agreements**
4. **Cultivates Trust and Safety**
5. **Maintains Presence**

### C. Communicating Effectively
6. **Listens Actively**
7. **Evokes Awareness**

### D. Cultivating Learning and Growth
8. **Facilitates Client Growth**

Each competency is further defined by specific behavioral markers (PCC Markers) that indicate how coaches demonstrate these skills in practical coaching situations.

## Understanding PCC Markers

The PCC Markers are behaviors that represent demonstration of the Core Competencies in a coaching conversation at the Professional Certified Coach (PCC) level. These markers support a performance evaluation process that is fair, consistent, valid, reliable, repeatable and defensible.

Key points about PCC Markers:
- They are used by assessors to evaluate coaching performance for ICF credentials
- They represent observable behaviors in coaching conversations
- They should NOT be used as a checklist in a formulaic manner
- They can help coaches identify areas for growth and skill development
- A minimum number of markers need to be demonstrated to pass PCC performance evaluations

For a detailed visualization of how these competencies and markers relate to each other, see the [Competency Marker Map](visualization/competency-marker-map.md).
