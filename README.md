# ICF Core Competencies Reference Guide

This repository serves as a comprehensive reference for professional coaches following the International Coach Federation (ICF) Core Competencies framework. The materials are organized to help coaches understand, implement, and demonstrate these competencies in their coaching practice.

## About the ICF Core Competencies

The ICF Core Competencies form the foundation of professional coaching practice as defined by the International Coach Federation. These competencies are organized into four main domains:

1. **Establishes and maintains agreements** (Competencies 1-4)
2. **Cultivates trust and safety** (Competencies 5-8)
3. **Maintains presence** (Competencies 9-13)
4. **Facilitates client growth** (Competencies 29-37)

Each competency is further defined by specific behavioral markers that indicate how coaches demonstrate these skills in practical coaching situations.

## Repository Structure

- `competency-frameworks/`: Contains detailed descriptions of each core competency domain
