# ICF Core Competencies and PCC Markers Map

This document provides visual mappings of how the ICF core competencies and their associated PCC markers relate to each other, the coaching process, and client outcomes. These maps are based on the official ICF PCC Markers (Revised November 2020) and can help coaches understand the interconnected nature of the competencies and how they flow together in coaching sessions.

## ICF Core Competencies Framework Overview

The ICF Core Competencies framework consists of 8 core competencies organized into 4 domains:

## Using the Marker Maps

Coaches can use these maps to:

1. **Plan sessions**: Identify which competencies and markers to focus on at different phases
2. **Self-assess**: Evaluate which competencies they execute well vs. need development
3. **Develop skills**: Focus on mastering related competencies together rather than in isolation
4. **Maintain flow**: Understand how competencies naturally transition during coaching conversations
5. **Prepare for ICF credential assessments**: Understand which markers assessors will be listening for

## Examples of Marker Application

Here are some examples of how specific markers might sound in a coaching conversation:

### Establishing Agreements (3.1-3.4)
- "What would you like to focus on today?"
- "How will you know we've had a successful conversation?"
- "What makes this topic important to you right now?"
- "What aspects of this situation do we need to address to help you reach your goal?"

### Cultivating Trust and Safety (4.1-4.4)
- "I notice how thoughtfully you approach these challenges."
- "That sounds really challenging. How are you managing through this?"
- "Thank you for sharing that perspective. Tell me more about what's behind that belief."
- "I have a thought to offer here - would that be helpful, or would you prefer to explore further yourself?"

### Evoking Awareness (7.1-7.8)
- "What values are at play for you in this situation?"
- "How might you view this situation differently if you weren't worried about the outcome?"
- "What possibilities exist that you haven't considered yet?"
- "What's at stake if nothing changes?"
- "I'm noticing a shift in your energy when you talk about this aspect - what's happening for you there?"

### Facilitating Client Growth (8.1-8.9)
- "What insights are you taking away from our conversation today?"
- "What have you learned about yourself through exploring this topic?"
- "How might you apply this new perspective in your situation?"
- "What specific actions would support your goals moving forward?"
- "How would you like to hold yourself accountable for these next steps?"

## Key Points About ICF Marker Assessment

1. Markers should not be used as a checklist in a formulaic manner
2. They represent behaviors that demonstrate competencies in a coaching conversation
3. A minimum number of markers must be demonstrated to pass performance evaluations
4. Markers support a fair, consistent, valid, reliable, repeatable and defensible evaluation process
5. They can also support coaches in identifying areas for growth and skill development
