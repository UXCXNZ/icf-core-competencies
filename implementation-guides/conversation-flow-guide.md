# Coaching Conversation Flow Guide

This guide maps the natural flow of a coaching conversation to specific ICF competencies, providing a practical framework for coaches to implement the competencies in sequence. Rather than seeing competencies as isolated skills, this approach demonstrates how they build upon each other in a coherent conversation.

## Conversation Structure and Competency Integration

The table below outlines 29 key conversation points in a typical coaching session, matching each with the relevant ICF competency markers and suggested questions.

| Stage | Conversation Point | Marker Intention | Marker Numbers | Sample Questions |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Opening (Setting the Foundation)** |
| 1 | Response to client's story | Acknowledge the client; show empathy | 5, 6 | "Thank you for sharing that. What an exciting/challenging time for you. I'd like to acknowledge you for..." |
| 2 | Bullet the client's content | Clear and succinct reflection; pause | 20, 13 | Reflect back presenting issue, client experience, and session intention with pauses to allow for processing |
| 3 | Inquire on session intention | Respond to the what | 10 | "What makes [session intention] important for you?" "How would you like this conversation to serve you today?" |
| 4 | Mind Expansion | Expand significance, understanding, explore language, inquire positive differences | 7, 9, 15, 16, 10, 12, 13, 19, 28 | "What makes X important to you?" "When you say X, what do you mean by this?" "What positive difference will X bring to you?" |
| 5 | Zero in on EOD (End of Discussion) | Discover what client is revealing about themselves and what they want/desire | 9, 14, 11 | "[Enumerate EOD options] Which would be most meaningful to discuss today?" |
| 6 | Inquire on EOD significance | Going into the who | 9, 14, 22 | "What makes [EOD] important to you?" "What makes you desire it now?" |
| 7 | Zero in on End result | Positive difference of EOD going into the what | 10, 14 | "What positive difference would [EOD] bring to you?" |
| 8 | Review the conversation | Summarize presenting issue, EOD, and end result | | Bullet point summary of the conversation thus far |
| **Contracting (Agreement Phase)** |
| 9 | Ask for focus | Inquiring what client wants to accomplish in session | 1 | "In terms of [EOD], what outcome would you like to have at the end of the session?" "How would you like to explore this further?" |
| 10 | Expand on focus | Exploring what is meaningful about the focus | 3 | Explore significance, meaning, positive difference related to focus |
| 11 | Bullet back additional content and reconfirm focus | Letting client choose what happens in conversation | 11 | "I'm hearing you want to focus on... [BULLET BACK AND RECONFIRM]" |
| 12 | Ask for measure of success | Define measure of success on focus | 2 | "By the end of our session, how would you know we have realized [focus]?" "How would you know you are able to [focus]?" |
| **Exploration (Deepening Awareness)** |
| 13 | Draw out client's current way | Inquire current way of thinking, feeling or doing | | "Where are you right now in terms of [focus]?" |
| 14 | Inquire for intention for change | Define what client believes they need to address | 4 | "In terms of [focus], what do you think needs your attention?" "What might you need to resolve this for yourself?" |
| 15 | Explore beyond current way | Inquire about desired way of thinking, feeling, doing | 14, 10, 9, 24 | "What are you ideally wanting to create?" "How do you imagine yourself showing up differently?" |
| 16 | Explore how client relates to situation | Explore expanded ways of relating to situation | 23, 21 | "What is standing in the way?" "What is concerning you right now?" "What makes [verb] challenging for you?" |
| 17 | Make sense of client's content | Make observation without attachment, check with client | 8, 25, 27 | Share observations clearly and concisely, without attachment |
| 18 | Inquire about client's perception | Explore how client currently perceives themselves/world | 18, 24 | "You seem to have a belief that..." "What is true/not true about...?" "How is this belief serving you?" |
| 19 | Draw out emerging understanding | Notice client shift in behavior | 17 | "I notice something's coming up for you. What is it?" "What is new in your awareness?" "What is emerging for you?" |
| 20 | Connect back to "who" focus | Explore what client is revealing about themselves | 22, 21 | "What makes [emerging understanding] important to you?" "What makes you desire it now?" |
| **Meaning-Making (Learning Phase)** |
| 21 | Draw out learning about self | Explore client learning about themselves | 30, 28 | "What are you learning about yourself in this session?" |

| **Action Planning (Closing Phase)** |
| 25 | Post-session mindset and action | Design post-session thinking, reflection or action | 33 | "What would your mindset need to be to take the next step forward?" "What actions are you ready to commit to?" |
| 26 | Resource, support and barriers | Inquire about resources, support and potential barriers | 34, 26 | "What resources might you need?" "Who would you reach out to for support?" "What potential barriers might stand in your way?" |
| 27 | Accountability | Design best method of accountability | 35 | "How will you hold yourself accountable?" |
| 28 | Check out marker | Acknowledge client's work; celebrate learning/progress | 5, 36 | "What's the biggest learning you had during the session?" "What do you want to celebrate about yourself right now?" |
| 29 | Close | Partner with client on how to close session | 37 | "Is there anything you would like to say to make our session more complete?" "Is this a good place to close the session?" |

## Competency Flow Visualization

This flow diagram illustrates how specific competencies tend to cluster in different phases of the coaching conversation:

## Key Insights from the Conversation Map

1. **Competency Clusters**: Certain competencies naturally cluster together at specific points in the conversation. For example, markers 5, 6 (acknowledging, showing empathy) appear at both the beginning and end of a session.

2. **Competency Frequency**: Some competencies appear frequently throughout the conversation, such as marker 14 (customizing questions based on client), while others serve specific functions at particular moments, such as marker 37 (partnering on closing).

3. **Transitions Between Domains**: The conversation map shows how coaches naturally transition between competency domains:
   - From "Establishes and maintains agreements" (markers 1-4) in the early phase
   - To "Cultivates trust and safety" (markers 5-8) throughout
   - Through "Maintains presence" (markers 9-13) as a foundation
   - With "Evokes awareness" (markers 14-28) dominating the middle exploration
   - Ending with "Facilitates client growth" (markers 29-37) in the closing phases

4. **Competency Layering**: Multiple competencies often operate simultaneously. For example, in the "Mind Expansion" conversation point, up to nine different competency markers may be engaged concurrently.

## Practical Application Guidelines

### Starting Strong: Opening and Contracting (Points 1-12)

**Key Competencies**: 1-7, 9-11, 13, 19, 20

**Best Practices**:
- Begin with acknowledgment and empathy (5, 6) before moving to agreements
- Ensure clear identification of session focus (1) and measures of success (2)
- Explore significance and meaning (3) before diving into what needs to be addressed (4)
- Use pauses and silence strategically (13) to allow for client reflection
- Practice clear, concise summarization (20) to confirm understanding

### Deepening Exploration: Middle Phase (Points 13-20)

**Key Competencies**: 14-28

**Best Practices**:
- Move from current reality to desired future (14 → 15)
- Explore both factual situation and client's relationship to it (16, 18)
- Share observations without attachment (25) and with concise language (27)
- Notice and inquire about energy shifts or non-verbal cues (17)
- Allow the client to do most of the talking (28)
- Continually connect exploration back to the client's focus (20)

### Harvesting Learning: Insight Phase (Points 21-24)

**Key Competencies**: 28-32

**Best Practices**:
- Explicitly invite learning reflection about self (30) and situation (31)
- Check in about progress toward session goals (29)
- Connect learning to future application (32)
- Continue allowing client to do most of the talking (28)

### Sealing the Value: Closing Phase (Points 25-29)

**Key Competencies**: 33-37, 5

**Best Practices**:
- Design specific post-session thinking and action (33)
- Explore resources, support, and potential barriers (34)
- Co-create accountability methods (35)
- Celebrate progress and learning (36)
- Partner on session completion (37)
- Bookend the session with acknowledgment (5) just as you began

## Common Conversation Flow Challenges

### Challenge 1: Premature Movement to Action
When a coach moves to action planning before sufficient exploration, skipping from points 9-12 directly to 24-27.

**Solution**: Use competencies 18, 21-23 to ensure adequate exploration of perceptions and learning before moving to action.

### Challenge 2: Overemphasis on the Situation vs. the Client
When a coach focuses extensively on the external situation without exploring the client's relationship to it.

**Solution**: Balance markers 23 (exploring situation) with markers 22 (exploring self-perception) and 30 (learning about self).

### Challenge 3: Unclear Agreements
When a coach begins exploration without clear focus and measure of success.

**Solution**: Ensure markers 1-4 are thoroughly addressed before moving to deeper exploration.

### Challenge 4: Neglecting Celebration
When a coach completes action planning but skips marker 36 (celebrating progress).

**Solution**: Intentionally incorporate acknowledgment and celebration before closing.

## Integration with Marker Timing

```

## Practical Implementation Exercise

1. **Self-Assessment**: Review your recent coaching conversations and identify which conversation points and associated markers you naturally emphasize or might inadvertently skip.

2. **Gap Analysis**: Compare your typical conversation flow with the 29-point map to identify opportunities for more comprehensive competency integration.

3. **Deliberate Practice**: Choose 1-2 conversation points and associated markers that you'd like to strengthen, and practice implementing them in your next coaching sessions.

4. **Peer Review**: Record a coaching session (with permission) and have a peer or mentor coach review it against this conversation flow map.

5. **Client Feedback**: Design specific questions to gather client feedback on different phases of your coaching conversation.

By mastering this conversation flow, coaches can move from mechanical application of individual competencies to a fluid integration that serves clients powerfully while demonstrating ICF competency requirements.
