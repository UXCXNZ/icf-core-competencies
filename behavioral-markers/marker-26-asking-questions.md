# Behavioral Marker 26: Asking Effective Questions

> **Coach asks clear, direct, primarily open-ended questions, one at a time, at a pace that allows for thinking, feeling or reflection by the client.**

## Purpose of this Competency

Effective questioning is at the heart of coaching. This competency focuses on how coaches formulate and deliver questions that create space for client reflection and insight. The quality, structure, and pacing of questions significantly impacts the depth of exploration and the client's ability to access new awareness.

## Why This Matters

- **Creates thinking space**: Well-crafted questions invite clients to think beyond their current understanding
- **Promotes depth**: Open-ended questions allow for exploration rather than simple yes/no responses
- **Respects processing**: Appropriate pacing recognizes that reflection takes time
- **Avoids overwhelm**: Asking one question at a time helps clients focus their thinking
- **Enhances clarity**: Direct, clear questions prevent confusion and misinterpretation

## Observable Behaviors

### DO:
- Ask open-ended questions that start with "what," "how," "where," "when," or "who"
- Use clear, concise language that is easy to understand
- Pause after asking a question to allow the client time to think
- Offer one question at a time before moving to another
- Adjust pacing based on the client's thinking style and energy
- Ensure questions are relevant to the client's stated goals
- Frame questions in a way that expands thinking rather than narrows it

### DON'T:
- Stack multiple questions together without allowing time for response
- Rush to fill silence after asking a question
- Use leading questions that suggest a particular answer
- Ask primarily closed questions (yes/no) that limit exploration
- Ask vague or complex questions that confuse the client
- Use "why" questions that may trigger defensiveness
- Interrupt client's reflection with follow-up questions too quickly

## Examples in Practice

### Effective Examples:
- "What options do you see available to you right now?" (followed by silence)
- "How would success in this situation look for you?"
- "What's important to you about finding a solution to this challenge?"
- "What feelings come up when you think about having that conversation?"
- "When you consider the different approaches we've discussed, which one resonates most with you?"

### Less Effective Examples:
- "Why haven't you tried talking to your manager yet?" (why question that may sound judgmental)
- "Have you considered option A, or maybe option B, or what about trying option C?" (stacked questions)
- "Don't you think you should approach it differently next time?" (leading question)
- "Yes or no, are you going to do it?" (closed question that limits exploration)
- "So what's going on with all of that stuff we talked about last time and how are you feeling about the new approach and did you notice any changes?" (complex, multi-part question)

## Development Progression

### Beginner Level:
- Focuses primarily on asking open-ended vs. closed questions
- May occasionally stack questions or rush past silence
- Questions tend to be formulaic or drawn from coaching models
- May struggle with question clarity or conciseness

### Intermediate Level:
- Consistently asks clear, open-ended questions
- Allows for silence after questions most of the time
- Questions flow more naturally from the client's responses
- Adjusts pacing somewhat based on client needs

### Advanced Level:
- Questions consistently create new awareness and possibilities
- Masterful use of silence, comfortable with extended reflection time
- Questions appear simple yet create profound thinking
- Exceptional attunement to client's processing pace and style
- Questions flow organically from deep listening to the client

## Self-Assessment Reflection

Consider your questioning practice by reflecting on these questions:

1. How comfortable am I with silence after asking a question?
2. Do I notice myself asking multiple questions at once when I'm unsure?
3. What percentage of my questions are truly open-ended?
4. Do I rush to my next question or allow adequate reflection time?
5. How do I adjust my questioning pace for different clients?
6. Are my questions clear and concise, or do they sometimes confuse clients?
7. How often do my questions create visible shifts in client awareness?

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Question Clarity
Record a coaching session (with permission) and review your questions. For each question, assess:
- Is it clear or confusing?
- Is it open or closed?
- Is it one question or multiple questions?
- Does it use simple language?

### Exercise 2: Silence Timer
Use a timer during coaching sessions to track how long you wait after asking a question before speaking again. Aim to gradually increase your comfort with longer silences.

### Exercise 3: Question Journal
Keep a journal of powerful questions that created noticeable shifts for clients. Review periodically to identify patterns in effective questioning.

### Exercise 4: Peer Feedback
Partner with another coach to observe each other's questioning technique and provide specific feedback on clarity, directness, and pacing.
