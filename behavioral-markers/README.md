# ICF Behavioral Markers

This directory contains detailed documentation for each of the 37 behavioral markers used to assess coaching competencies according to the International Coach Federation (ICF) Core Competencies framework.

## Understanding the Numbering Systems

ICF uses a hierarchical numbering system where markers are numbered according to their associated competency (e.g., 3.1, 4.2, etc.). For internal tracking purposes, we sometimes use a simple sequential numbering system (1-37) across all competencies. Both systems are referenced in these documents for clarity and ease of use.

## Markers Used for "Embodies a Coaching Mindset"

The competency "Embodies a Coaching Mindset" (Competency 2) is unique in that it does not have its own specific markers. Instead, it is assessed through markers from other competencies:

- 4.1 (Sequential #5)
- 4.3 (Sequential #7)
- 4.4 (Sequential #8)
- 5.1 (Sequential #9)
- 5.2 (Sequential #10)

- 5.4 (Sequential #12)
- 6.1 (Sequential #14)
- 6.5 (Sequential #18)
- 7.1 (Sequential #21)
- 7.5 (Sequential #25)

## Demonstrates Ethical Practice

Competency 1, "Demonstrates Ethical Practice," does not have specific numbered behavioral markers. It is assessed through overall alignment with the ICF Code of Ethics in the coaching conversation.

## Using These Behavioral Markers

These markers serve as indicators that an assessor is trained to listen for when evaluating coaching conversations. They support a performance evaluation process that is fair, consistent, valid, reliable, repeatable, and defensible.

Important notes:
- These markers should not be used as a checklist in a formulaic manner
- They represent observable behaviors that demonstrate competencies in coaching
- They can help coaches identify areas for growth and skill development
