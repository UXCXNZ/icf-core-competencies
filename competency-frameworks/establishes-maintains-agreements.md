# Establishes and Maintains Agreements

## Domain Overview

This foundational domain focuses on the coach's ability to create clear understanding with the client about the coaching relationship and process. It ensures alignment between coach and client about session objectives, measures of success, and what matters most to the client.

## Key Elements

- **Partnership approach**: The coach works collaboratively with the client, not dictating the agenda
- **Clear objectives**: Defining specific outcomes for each session
- **Success metrics**: Establishing how progress will be measured
- **Meaningful exploration**: Understanding what is important to the client about their goals
- **Needs assessment**: Identifying what must be addressed to achieve desired outcomes

## Competency Markers

### 1. Coach partners with the client to identify or reconfirm what the client wants to accomplish in this session.

This marker represents the initial contracting for the session's direction and focus. The coach helps the client clarify and articulate what they want to achieve within the specific timeframe of the session.

**Observable behaviors:**
- Asking open questions about session goals
- Checking for clarity on the client's desired outcomes
- Revisiting the goal during the session when appropriate
- Redirecting the conversation back to the client's stated objectives

**Common challenges:**
- Assuming the client's goal without explicit confirmation
- Moving forward with unclear objectives
- Not reconfirming when the conversation shifts to new areas

### 2. Coach partners with the client to define or reconfirm measure(s) of success for what the client wants to accomplish in this session.

This marker focuses on establishing clear indicators of progress or achievement for the session. The coach helps the client articulate how they will know they've made meaningful progress.

**Observable behaviors:**
- Asking "How will you know this session has been successful?"
- Helping the client define specific, tangible outcomes
- Checking for alignment between goals and success measures
- Using the client's own metrics rather than imposing coach's ideas

**Common challenges:**
- Skipping the step of defining success measures
- Creating vague measures that aren't specific enough to track
- Not ensuring the measures are meaningful to the client

### 3. Coach inquires about or explores what is important or meaningful to the client about what they want to accomplish in this session.

This marker addresses the deeper significance of the client's goals, connecting the what (objective) with the why (meaning). The coach helps the client articulate values and motivations tied to their goals.

**Observable behaviors:**
- Asking about the personal significance of the client's goals
- Exploring how the goal connects to the client's values
- Inquiring about the impact of achieving the desired outcome
- Noticing and acknowledging emotions connected to the client's goal

**Common challenges:**
- Focusing solely on tactical aspects without exploring meaning
- Moving too quickly past the "why" to the "how"
- Missing emotional cues about what matters most to the client

### 4. Coach partners with the client to define what the client believes they need to address to achieve what they want to accomplish in this session.

This marker involves identifying the specific aspects of a situation that need attention for the client to move forward. It helps create a roadmap for the coaching conversation.

**Observable behaviors:**
- Asking what elements need to be addressed to achieve the goal
- Exploring barriers or challenges that might need to be overcome
- Helping the client prioritize areas to focus on
- Checking how addressing these areas connects to the desired outcome

**Common challenges:**
- Assuming what needs to be addressed without client input
- Rushing to solutions before fully exploring the component parts
- Not connecting the "needs to be addressed" with the session goal

## Application in Coaching Sessions

Effective establishment and maintenance of agreements typically follows this flow:

1. Begin with broad exploration of what the client wants to work on (Marker 1)
2. Define specific success measures that will indicate progress (Marker 2)
3. Connect the goal to deeper meaning and motivation (Marker 3)
4. Break down the components that need to be addressed (Marker 4)
5. Revisit these agreements throughout the session as needed

## Integration with Other Domains

"Establishes and maintains agreements" connects with:

- **Cultivates trust and safety**: Clear agreements build trust in the coaching relationship
- **Maintains presence**: Staying focused on agreements demonstrates presence with client goals
- **Evokes awareness**: Exploration of what's meaningful often leads to new awareness
- **Facilitates client growth**: Agreements provide the foundation for measuring progress

## Assessment Indicators

### Proficient Level
- Coach consistently establishes clear session objectives with the client
- Success measures are defined but may not always be specific or measurable
- Some exploration of meaning and what needs to be addressed occurs

### Skilled Level
- Coach and client co-create specific, measurable session objectives
- Success measures are clear and aligned with client values
- Thorough exploration of meaning and components to address
- Agreements are revisited and adjusted as the session progresses

### Mastery Level
- Seamless integration of all agreement markers in a natural flow
- Deep exploration of meaning that connects to client's core values
- Ability to hold the agreed focus while allowing for emergence of new insights
