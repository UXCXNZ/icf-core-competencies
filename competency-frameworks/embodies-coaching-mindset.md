# Embodies a Coaching Mindset

## Official ICF Definition

**Embodies a Coaching Mindset:** Develops and maintains a mindset that is open, curious, flexible and client-centered.

## Overview

"Embodies a Coaching Mindset" is one of the two foundational competencies in the ICF Core Competencies framework, alongside "Demonstrates Ethical Practice." This competency focuses on the coach's overall approach, attitude, and ongoing professional development rather than specific behaviors within a single coaching session.

What makes this competency unique is that it represents an ongoing process of development that takes place over the course of a coach's professional journey. While certain elements of this competency can be demonstrated within a coaching conversation, the full embodiment of a coaching mindset cannot be fully captured in a single moment in time.

## Key Aspects of Embodying a Coaching Mindset

According to the ICF, embodying a coaching mindset involves:

1. **Developing and maintaining an open, curious, flexible and client-centered mindset**
2. **Engaging in ongoing learning and development** as a coach
3. **Establishing a reflective practice** to continually grow and evolve
4. **Preparing thoroughly for coaching sessions**
5. **Remaining aware of and open to the influence of context and culture** on oneself and others
6. **Using awareness of self and intuition** to benefit clients
7. **Developing and maintaining the ability to regulate one's emotions**

9. **Seeking help from outside sources** when necessary

## Evolution in the Revised ICF Competency Model

The "Embodies a Coaching Mindset" competency was newly added in the revised ICF Core Competency model. This addition highlights several important aspects of professional coaching:

1. **The importance of ongoing professional development** - Recognizing that coaching mastery is a continuous journey
2. **The value of reflective practice** - Emphasizing the coach's self-awareness and learning
3. **The coach's presence as a foundational element** - Acknowledging that who the coach is being impacts the coaching relationship
4. **The spiritual dimension of coaching** - Recognizing that mastery requires nurturing our inner capacity to connect, notice, attune and express

As the competency description notes, a coach who isn't engaged in their own ongoing practice of inner work has limited capacity to recognize the growth available for their client. The ability to embrace our full selves enables us to more fully embrace our clients.

## Conclusion

"Embodies a Coaching Mindset" represents the being aspect of coaching, as opposed to the doing. While specific behaviors can demonstrate this mindset in action, the competency is fundamentally about the coach's ongoing development journey and the consciousness they bring to each coaching relationship. By cultivating openness, curiosity, flexibility, and client-centeredness, coaches create the foundation for transformative coaching conversations.
